Qmail-Deliverable
=================

qmail-smtpd does not know if a user exists. Lots of resources are wasted by
scanning mail for spam and viruses for addresses that do not exist anyway.

A replacement smtpd written in Perl could use this module to quickly verify
that a local email address is (probably) actually in use.

This module comes with a daemon program called qmail-deliverabled and a module
called Qmail::Deliverable::Client that copies the entire public interface, but
queries the daemon. Typically, the daemon runs as the root user, and the client
is used by the unprivileged smtpd.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires a functional qmail installation in its standard location,
/var/qmail.
